## Imparcialoaxaca.mx design implementation

_HTML5_, _CSS3_, _SASS_, _Bootstrap 3_, _PHP 7_

This Project was about implementing a new web design for imparcialoaxaca.mx. The custom framework mentioned is a PHP framework called ‘Enchinga’ (It is a MVC). I was a front-end developer, so I mostly had to work with the templates and a couple of things in the backend if needed. This was one of the early SASS implementation I was involved. We were also using bootstrap, although the design required us to twick the grid to match it.
