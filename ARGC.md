This Project was about implementing a web design for [arealgoodcause.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20131128071802/http://arealgoodcause.com/). It was one of the earliest Drupal project I worked on. This is one of the earliest theming jobs I worked in oDesk (now Upwork).

As a theming job it was mostly about using tools as Panels, Views & some other plugins. The tech was HTML & CSS with some recent features (at that time). Drupal theming was very particular specially because of the overwritting features but it was a very good experience.
