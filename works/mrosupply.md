# MROSupply front-end &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _2014_

`HTML 5`, `CSS 3`, `Javascript`, `jQuery`, `Django`, `HTML for emails`, `mailchimp`

**The screenshots are previous version of the website during my contract**

**The source code of the website, app & the landing page are not available**

Initially I started my work with MROSupply due to a migration to a new website. The content of many of the products had `CSS` styles that had to be edited. For example; the previous website had orange tables that had to be styled again. Firts it was edited manually and then automated with a `PHP` script, `DOMDocument` & `Regex`. Later I was assisting with front-end related tasks. By that time `jQuery` was still being used.
The website was developed using `HTML`, `CSS`, `Javascript` and `Django-cms`. Although I did not take part in the development I was a contributor and learn many of the tech they were using.
I also was assisting them with their email campaings with `mailchimp`. I was also helped them for many of the automatic emails `Django-cms` was sending. I learned `HTML for emails` as it can be very different from regulal `HTML`. I got used to `mailchimp` templates, among other things.
The work with the emails was a task with a lot of responsibility as they were sent many times to at least 25000+ people.
