# First personal website (mechdeveloper.com) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _2012_

`PHP 5`, `Drupal 7`, `HTML 5`, `CSS 3`, `Javascript`

**You can check the (archived) website [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20130409073648/http://mechdeveloper.com/)**

First of all, I struggled a lot to pick a name for the website and somehow I got it wrong anyway. The name itself had to do a lot with the theming of the website. I do not think I will do that again.

I also made a couple of bold claims that nowadays I would have revised.

That website was built using Drupal 7 and required the use of many Drupal features (Blocks, Views, Panels, Theme extensions, … this was not small). I liked Drupal the most because of its modules. I also enjoyed theming Drupal a lot.

Many of my jobs the few years I started freelancing were Drupal jobs.
