### SABRE api &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _~2013_

`HTML 5`, `CSS 3`, `Angular 1`, `MongoDB`, `mongoid`, `Ruby`, `Ruby on Rails`, `Sabre API`, `savon`, `SOAP`, `XML`

**unfortunately the app is not available publicly**

_WIP (by now a duplicate of readme part is shown here)_ 

In this project I was involved I had to connect a SABRE API with an app. I was allowed to write the app in Ruby on Rails & MongoDB. I had to use SOAP & savon for the api consumption and Angular 1 for the UI.
