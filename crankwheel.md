# Crankwheel website maintainer &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _2020 (ongoing)_

![](./assets/img/crankwheel.png)

`HTML 5`, `CSS 3`, `Javascript`, `VanillaJS`, `imagemagick`, `shell scripting`, `jekyll`, `GitHub Actions`, `bash`, `forestry.io`, `TinaCMS`

**You can check the website [here](https://crankwheel.com/)**

**The source code of the website is not available**

I have been the website maintainer for CrankWheel.com, which is built using `Jekyll` and hosted in `Netlify`. This is not just a simple website, as it involves complex maintenance and optimization tasks. My responsibilities include the creation and maintanance of the code of the website and its parts (collections, includes, templates, ...). I ensure that all pages are editable in the `CMS`. It formerly used `forestry.io` but later migrated to `TinaCMS`. Additionally, I implemented a `GitHub Actions` workflow with `bash` scripts that uses `ImageMagick` to automatically transform and optimize images based on screen size, generating both WebP and AVIF formats.
