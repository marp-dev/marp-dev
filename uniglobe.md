### Uniglobe's Customer Portal & Amadeus API &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _2011_

`HTML 4`, `CSS 2`, `PHP 5`, `MySQL`, `AJAX`, `jQuery`, `VTiger`, `Smarty templates`, `CRP`, `Amadeus`, `Ubuntu`

**Unfortunately there are no links to these projects in this document**

These were a set of projects related to each other;
First, there was the CRP based on VTiger that we had to maintain and extend with many features oriented for the travel industry. In this period I was also working as a server admin for this project in particular. I also made several improvements to the database and SQL of the system.
Second, there was the Customer Portal. Partially provided by VTiger and heavily modified. The company had plans to combine it with a GDS (Amadeus in this case) and offer it to its corporative clients. The Amadeus API was provided via L'alianXa.
